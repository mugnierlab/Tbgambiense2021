# Data File Contents:

* "All_VSG_BLASTtreeNterm.types.xlsx" an excel table detailing the N-terminal domain type for each sequence ID as determined by the BLASTp tree analysis
* "Cross et al.csv" a table of N-terminal and C-terminal domain type classifications from previous publications, presented in doi:10.1016/j.molbiopara.2014.06.004
* "CterminalNetwork.csv" the table of pairwise BLASTp results of C-terminal domain sequences used to generate a network plot in igraph
* "GambienseTypeMethodCompare.csv" a comparison of N-terminal domain types for the 44 highly expressed T.b. gambiense VSG using three classification methods: HMM pipeline, BLASTp tree, network plot
* "GAMC_VSGnome2Tb427_2018.translation.txt" a reference matching old VSG fasta ID names to their counterparts in more recent genome assemblies
* "Mugnier2015_allMiceTyped.csv" merged VSG-seq and HMM N-terminal typing results for mouse data from doi:10.1126/science.aaa4502
* "Mugnier2015_parasitemia.csv" estimated parasitemia for each mouse blood sample collection 
* "Mulindwa2018_rhodesienseVSGtyped.csv" merged VSG-seq and HMM N-terminal typing results for T.b. rhodesiense patients from http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006280
* "NetworkPlot_clusterReference.csv" a reference to match Trinity IDs to cluster names which were used to compare VSg sequences which assembled in multiple patients
* "NterminalNetwork.csv" the table of pairwise BLASTp results of N-terminal domain sequences used to generate network plots in igraph
* "SuppTable5VSGTypeMethodCompare.csv" a table comparing the typing results for tb427 of three different methods. Does not include blast-tree types for patient VSG because this analysis was not performed on the rhodesiense patients
* "TbgAssembledVSG.csv" merged VSG-seq and HMM typing results for assembled T.b. gambiense patients which met 1% sequence quality cutoff
* "TbgHighlyExpressed.csv" HMM typing and C-terminal network results for the highly expressed T.b. gambiense VSG which met 1% cutoff in at least two technical replicates
